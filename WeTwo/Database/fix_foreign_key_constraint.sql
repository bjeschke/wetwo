-- Fix Foreign Key Constraint Issue
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- 1. Check current foreign key constraints
SELECT 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
      AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
      AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND tc.table_name='profiles';

-- 2. Drop the foreign key constraint temporarily
ALTER TABLE profiles DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_id_fkey;

-- 3. Verify the constraint is dropped
SELECT 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
      AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
      AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND tc.table_name='profiles';

-- 4. Alternative: Recreate the constraint with DEFERRABLE option
-- ALTER TABLE profiles ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_id_fkey 
--     FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
